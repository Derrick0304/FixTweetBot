# Privacy Policy for FixTweetBot
**Effective Date:** 06/05/2025

This Privacy Policy explains how *FixTweetBot* (“the Bot”, “we”, “our”) collects, uses, stores, and manages data in connection with its operation as a Discord bot. By using *FixTweetBot*, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this policy.

---

## 1. Data Controller
The Bot is operated by an individual under the pseudonym **Kyrela**, based in **France**. The service is provided globally and is not restricted to any specific region, though it operates exclusively on the Discord platform.

---

## 2. Data Collected

FixTweetBot collects the following categories of data:

- **User-specific Discord data:** User IDs, role IDs, server (guild) IDs, and text channel IDs.
- **Service configuration data:** Custom settings saved by users for link fixing behavior.
- **Operational logs (limited):**
  - Logs of errors including the user ID, guild ID, and any information that could help resolve the error, depending on the context.
  - Logs of successful usage events, including event type and timestamp.

**Note:** The bot does *not* collect or store message content or metadata beyond the above logging.

---

## 3. Scope of Data Collection

- The Bot does not operate or collect data via direct messages (DMs).
- Data may be collected within private servers if the bot is explicitly added there by a server administrator.

---

## 4. Purpose of Data Use

- **Command Functionality:** Data such as IDs and settings are used solely to execute the bot's link-fixing features, including per-server configuration.
- **Event Logging:** Event data is collected for non-identifying analytics, such as usage trends or performance display.
- **Error Tracking:** Error logs help identify and resolve bugs.

No profiling, advertising, or automated decision-making is performed using the data.

---

## 5. Data Storage and Security

- Data is stored on a privately operated Linux server located and maintained by the operator.
- Server access is restricted and protected using standard Linux security practices, with account-based access control and regular updates to address vulnerabilities.
- Logs are purged at each software update; service data remains persistent unless deleted at the user’s request.

Details of server architecture are intentionally withheld to protect security integrity.

---

## 6. Data Sharing and Third Parties

- No user data is shared with third parties.
- The Bot does not rely on or transmit data to any external APIs or third-party services that would receive user information.

---
